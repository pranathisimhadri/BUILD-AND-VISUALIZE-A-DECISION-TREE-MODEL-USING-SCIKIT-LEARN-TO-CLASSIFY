## üéØ Project: Movie Recommendation via Matrix Factorization in PyTorch

This project builds a **Collaborative Filtering-based Movie Recommender System** using **Matrix Factorization** with **PyTorch**, optimized for **GPU acceleration (CUDA)**.

It learns **latent embeddings** for users and movies such that their dot product approximates user ratings. This enables predicting user preferences and recommending top-N movies.

### üîç Objective

Use matrix factorization to decompose the user-item rating matrix into two low-dimensional matrices: one for user features and one for movie features. This method captures hidden patterns in user behavior and item popularity.

## üß† Technical Summary

### 1. **Preprocessing**

* Load ratings (`ratings.csv`) via pandas.
* Convert user/movie IDs to integer indices using `factorize()`.
* Split data into training/test sets.

### 2. **Dataset & Loader**

* Custom `RatingsDataset` returns user, movie, and rating.
* `DataLoader` enables mini-batch training.

### 3. **Model**

* `user_embedding` and `movie_embedding` via `nn.Embedding`.
* Dot product predicts the rating.
* Loss: Mean Squared Error (MSE).

### 4. Training

* Runs on GPU if available via `torch.device("cuda")`.
* Efficient training for large datasets.

### 5. Saving & Predicting

* Save/load model with `torch.save()` and `torch.load()`.
* Predict ratings or generate the full rating matrix.
